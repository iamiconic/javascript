should alwasys be evaluated immedietly and then continue to the next

round decimals so it does not overflow the screen

pressing equals will not evaluate until both numbers are filled

pressing clear should wipe out ALL data

display error when divide by 0

can only use the decimal once so 23.2.53. doesnt work
